# library.io

Library.io is an application for the management of user's books'! At its core, it focuses on allowing a user to categorize books into one of three categories.
Read books - books you've finished.
To read books - books you're planning on reading, but haven't quite gotten to.
and reading books - books you're currently reading.

Additionally,  library.io allows users to give a rating for the books they've read out of 5, as well as leave a review. 

Library.io has plans for users to create more shelves past the base three categories so books can form collections of their choosing.
For example, creating a shelf for your favourite fantasy novels from each series:
TWOK - Brandon Sanderson
ASOS - GRRM
TFOTR - JRR Tolkien
Assassin's Quest - Robin Hobb
